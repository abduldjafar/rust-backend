## Features
- **High Performance**: Leveraging Rustâ€™s concurrency and memory safety for optimized performance.
- **Scalable Database**: Uses SurrealDB for handling structured, semi-structured, and graph-based data efficiently.
- **Flexible & Extensible**: Designed with modularity in mind, making it straightforward to extend or modify as needed.

## Motivation
After being laid off, I wanted to make the most of my time by deepening my knowledge in Rust and experimenting with SurrealDB. This project is a sandbox where I can explore scalable backend designs while improving my Rust programming skills.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. Install dependencies and build:
    ```bash
    # Install Rust if not already installed
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    rustup override set stable

    # Build the project
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. Set up SurrealDB:
    - Download and install SurrealDB from [https://surrealdb.com](https://surrealdb.com)
    - Start the SurrealDB instance and configure it as needed.

## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
cargo run
